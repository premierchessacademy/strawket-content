I used to manage a lot of excel sheets and manually communicate to students. This was tedious and time consuming especially as the number of students grew ! 
Strawket saves me time and ensures all my students have class notes, practise links , quizzes etc. after every class. All automated. 
As a coach it has been a very smooth journey after Strawket and I would definitely recommend it !
